## Implementation Guide
### Overview of the Exact Phrase Redaction Feature
This feature allows you to search for and replace exact phrases within a document. It's especially useful for protecting sensitive information like personal names, addresses, or other identifiable data.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Redactor
Begin by initializing the `Redactor` class with the path to your target document:
```java
final Redactor redactor = new Redactor("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX");
```
This step sets up the environment for performing operations on your specified document.

#### Step 2: Apply Exact Phrase Redaction
Use the `ExactPhraseRedaction` class to find and replace specific text phrases. For example, replacing "John Doe" with "[personal]" is done as follows:
```java
redactor.apply(new ExactPhraseRedaction("John Doe\
