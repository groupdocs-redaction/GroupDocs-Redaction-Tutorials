- Optimize performance when using these capabilities.

Ready to get started? First, let's cover the prerequisites!

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

### Required Libraries and Versions
- GroupDocs.Redaction for Java version 24.9 or later.

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Java programming concepts such as classes, methods, and exception handling.

With these prerequisites in place, you're ready to set up GroupDocs.Redaction for Java!

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Redaction for Java

To use GroupDocs.Redaction in your projects, add it as a dependency. Here's how:

### Maven Installation

If using Maven, include the following configurations in your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/redaction/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-redaction</artifactId>
      <version>24.9</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Direct Download

Alternatively, download the latest version directly from [GroupDocs.Redaction for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/redaction/java/).

### License Acquisition
- **Free Trial:** Start with a free trial to explore functionalities.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license for extended testing.
- **Purchase:** Consider purchasing a full license for long-term use.

#### Basic Initialization and Setup
To initialize GroupDocs.Redaction in your Java application, include the necessary imports:

```java
import com.groupdocs.redaction.Redactor;
import com.groupdocs.redaction.options.SaveOptions;
import com.groupdocs.redaction.options.AdvancedRasterizationOptions;

public class DocumentProcessor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code will go here.
    }
}
```

Now, let's implement the custom border feature!

## Implementation Guide

### Advanced Rasterization with Custom Borders

In this section, we explore how to apply advanced rasterization options, including setting a custom border for your documents.

#### Loading and Preparing the Document

Start by loading the document you want to process:

```java
// Load the document you want to process.
final Redactor redactor = new Redactor("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/MULTIPAGE_SAMPLE_DOCX");
```

This step initializes the `Redactor` object, essential for any operations on your document.

#### Setting Save Options

Next, configure the save options to manage how and where the processed document will be saved:

```java
try {
    // Create SaveOptions and set a suffix for the saved file name.
    SaveOptions so = new SaveOptions();
    so.setRedactedFileSuffix("_scan");

    // Enable rasterization to apply advanced options.
    so.getRasterization().setEnabled(true);

    // Add custom border settings as an advanced option.
    so.getRasterization().addAdvancedOption(
        AdvancedRasterizationOptions.Border,
        new HashMap<String, String>() {
{
            put("borderColor", "black");
            put("borderWidth", "2");
        }
}
    );
    
    redactor.save(so);
} finally {
    redactor.close();
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `SaveOptions` specifies how the document should be saved post-processing.
- Rasterization is enabled to apply visual transformations, including borders.
- Custom border settings are added using a `HashMap`, defining `borderColor` and `borderWidth`.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your document path is correct; otherwise, you may encounter file not found exceptions.
- Verify that the GroupDocs.Redaction library version matches what's specified in your project dependencies to avoid compatibility issues.

### Practical Applications

The advanced rasterization feature with custom borders can be applied in various scenarios:
1. **Legal Documents:** Adding a distinct border when redacting sensitive parts enhances clarity and professionalism.
2. **Medical Records:** Securely redact personal information while maintaining document format.
3. **Financial Reports:** Highlight specific sections for review or compliance purposes.

### Performance Considerations

When working with large documents, consider these tips to optimize performance:
- Manage memory usage by closing the `Redactor` object promptly after saving the document.
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms when processing and transforming content.
- Regularly monitor application performance and adjust configurations as needed.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've learned how to leverage GroupDocs.Redaction for Java to apply advanced rasterization with custom borders. This feature enhances document security while preserving their layout and visual integrity. To further explore GroupDocs.Redaction's capabilities, consider experimenting with other redaction options or integrating it into larger systems.
