# How to Retrieve Document Information Using GroupDocs.Redaction in Java

Retrieving critical details about documents such as file type, number of pages, and size is essential for optimizing software applications like document management systems or content processing tools. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through using GroupDocs.Redaction for Java to efficiently retrieve document information.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up GroupDocs.Redaction in your Java project
- Retrieving key document information such as file type, page count, and size
- Troubleshooting common issues

Let's review the prerequisites before we begin.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing this feature, ensure you have the necessary tools and knowledge:

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies

To use GroupDocs.Redaction for Java, set up your development environment with Maven or download it from their repository. Ensure your system runs Java 8 or higher.

### Environment Setup Requirements

Install a suitable IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse. Make sure your project supports Maven dependencies if you choose this installation method.

### Knowledge Prerequisites

Familiarity with Java programming, particularly handling file operations and using third-party libraries, will be beneficial for following along with this tutorial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Redaction for Java

To use the GroupDocs.Redaction library in your Java project, follow these installation steps:

**Maven Installation**

Add the following repository and dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/redaction/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-redaction</artifactId>
      <version>24.9</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

**Direct Download**

Alternatively, download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Redaction for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/redaction/java/).

### License Acquisition
- **Free Trial:** Start with a free trial to evaluate the library.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license for extended evaluation.
- **Purchase:** Consider purchasing if it suits your needs.

Once installed, initialize and set up GroupDocs.Redaction:

```java
import com.groupdocs.redaction.Redactor;

// Initialize Redactor with the path to your document
final Redactor redactor = new Redactor("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX");
```

## Implementation Guide

Now that you've set everything up, retrieve the document information. Here's how:

### Retrieve Document Information

This feature allows you to access critical details about your documents like file type, number of pages, and size in bytes.

#### Step 1: Import Necessary Classes

Ensure you import necessary classes at the beginning of your Java file:

```java
import com.groupdocs.redaction.Redactor;
import com.groupdocs.redaction.domain.IDocumentInfo;
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Redactor

Create a `Redactor` instance, specifying the path to your document. This object allows you to interact with your documents.

```java
final Redactor redactor = new Redactor("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX");
try {
    // Code for retrieving information will go here.
} finally {
    redactor.close();
}
```

#### Step 3: Retrieve and Display Document Info

Use the `getDocumentInfo()` method to extract document details. This method returns an instance of `IDocumentInfo`, containing all necessary metadata.

```java
// Retrieve document information
IDocumentInfo info = redactor.getDocumentInfo();

// Output document type, page count, and size in bytes
System.out.println("File Type: " + info.getFileType());
System.out.println("Page Count: " + info.getPageCount());
System.out.println("Size (Bytes): " + info.getSize());
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Ensure Correct Path:** Verify the document path to prevent file not found errors.
- **Check Java Version:** GroupDocs.Redaction requires at least Java 8.

## Practical Applications

Understanding how to retrieve document information can be applied in several real-world scenarios:

1. **Document Management Systems:** Automatically categorize documents based on size or type for efficient storage and retrieval.
2. **Content Processing Tools:** Tailor processing algorithms depending on the number of pages or file type.
3. **Digital Asset Libraries:** Implement sorting and filtering features using document metadata.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large numbers of documents, performance can be crucial:

- Optimize memory usage by managing resources effectively within your application.
- Use efficient data structures to handle document metadata for quick access and processing.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've learned how to set up GroupDocs.Redaction in a Java project and retrieve valuable document information. By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate document metadata handling into your applications.

To take your skills further, explore additional features of GroupDocs.Redaction or delve deeper into the API's capabilities. Experiment with different functionalities to enhance your application.
