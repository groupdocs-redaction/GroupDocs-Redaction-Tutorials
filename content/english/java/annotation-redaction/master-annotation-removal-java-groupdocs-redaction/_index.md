      <version>24.9</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Direct Download
Alternatively, you can download the latest version from [GroupDocs.Redaction for Java releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/redaction/java/).

#### License Acquisition Steps
1. **Free Trial**: Start by downloading a trial version to explore basic functionalities.
2. **Temporary License**: Apply for a temporary license to unlock full features without limitations during your evaluation period.
3. **Purchase**: For long-term usage, consider purchasing a commercial license.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

To initialize GroupDocs.Redaction in your Java application:

```java
import com.groupdocs.redaction.Redactor;
import com.groupdocs.redaction.options.SaveOptions;

public class InitializeRedaction {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Load the document using Redactor
        final Redactor redactor = new Redactor("path/to/your/document");
        
        try {
            // Perform your redaction operations here
            
            // Save options can be customized as needed
            SaveOptions saveOptions = new SaveOptions();
            saveOptions.setAddSuffix(true);  // Example option: Add suffix to filename
            
            // Save the modified document
            redactor.save(saveOptions, "path/to/output/document");
        } finally {
            redactor.close();  // Always close resources to prevent memory leaks
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll break down how to remove specific annotations using regex with GroupDocs.Redaction.

### Removing Specific Annotations Using Regular Expression

This feature allows you to selectively delete annotations from your documents. The process involves loading the document, applying a regex-based redaction, and saving the updated file.

#### Step 1: Load Your Document
First, load the document from which you want to remove annotations:

```java
final Redactor redactor = new Redactor("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/ANNOTATED_XLSX");
```

#### Step 2: Apply Regex-Based Annotation Removal
Use the `DeleteAnnotationRedaction` class with a regex pattern to specify which annotations should be removed. This example removes annotations containing "use," "show," or "describe":

```java
redactor.apply(new DeleteAnnotationRedaction("(?im:(use|show|describe))"));
```

- **Parameters Explained**: The regex `(?im:(use|show|describe))` is case-insensitive (`i`) and allows for multiline matching (`m`). It targets annotations containing any of the specified words.

#### Step 3: Configure Save Options
Set up your save options to determine how the redacted document should be saved:

```java
SaveOptions saveOptions = new SaveOptions();
saveOptions.setAddSuffix(true);  // Append a suffix to the output filename
saveOptions.setRasterizeToPDF(false);  // Do not convert to PDF format
```

#### Step 4: Save and Release Resources
Finally, save your document and ensure resources are properly released:

```java
redactor.save(saveOptions, "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/RedactedDocument");
redactor.close();  // Always close the Redactor instance
```

**Troubleshooting Tips**: 
- Ensure regex patterns match the intended text.
- If saving fails, verify file paths and permissions.

## Practical Applications

The ability to remove specific annotations using regex with GroupDocs.Redaction can be applied in various scenarios:

1. **Document Cleanup for Legal Compliance**: Automatically removing sensitive information before sharing documents externally.
2. **Automated Document Processing Pipelines**: Streamlining workflows by cleaning up document annotations during batch processing.
3. **Data Anonymization**: Removing identifiable data from shared datasets to protect privacy.

## Performance Considerations

When working with GroupDocs.Redaction, consider these performance tips:

- Optimize regex patterns for efficiency to reduce processing time.
- Manage memory usage carefully by closing Redactor instances promptly after use.
- Profile your application to identify and address any bottlenecks in the redaction process.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you've learned how to set up GroupDocs.Redaction for Java and remove specific annotations using regex. This powerful functionality simplifies document management tasks, enabling cleaner and more compliant documents.
