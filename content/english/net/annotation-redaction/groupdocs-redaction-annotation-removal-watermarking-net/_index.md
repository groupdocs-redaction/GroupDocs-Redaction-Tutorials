In this section, we'll walk through removing annotations using GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET and setting up watermarking with GroupDocs.Watermark.

### Removing Annotations with GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET
#### Step-by-Step Overview:
GroupDocs.Redaction allows you to remove annotations efficiently from a variety of document formats. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Prepare Output Directory and Source File Path**
   Start by specifying the path to your document. Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Sample.docx"` with the actual path.
   
   ```csharp
   string sourceFile = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Sample.docx";
   ```

2. **Initialize the Redactor with the Source File**
   Use GroupDocs.Redaction's `Redactor` class to load your document.

   ```csharp
   using (Redactor redactor = new Redactor(sourceFile))
   {
       // Apply annotation removal logic here
   }
   ```

3. **Apply DeleteAnnotationRedaction**
   This step involves removing all annotations from the loaded document.

   ```csharp
   redactor.Apply(new DeleteAnnotationRedaction());
   ```

4. **Save the Document with a Redaction Suffix**
   Save the modified document, appending a suffix like `*_Redacted.*`.

   ```csharp
   var saveOptions = new SaveOptions { AddSuffix = true, RasterizeToPDF = false };
   redactor.Save(saveOptions);
   ```

### Setting Up Watermarks with GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET
#### Overview:
Watermarking your documents can add an extra layer of security and brand presence. Here's how to get started:

1. **Initialize the Watermarker**
   Begin by creating a `Watermarker` instance with the path to your document.

2. **Add Text or Image Watermarks**
   Customize and apply watermarks as needed.

   ```csharp
   using (TextWatermark watermark = new TextWatermark("Confidential", new Font("Arial", 36)))
   {
       watermark.ForegroundColor = Color.Red;
       watermarker.Add(watermark);
   }
   ```

3. **Save the Document**
   Ensure your changes are saved appropriately.

   ```csharp
   watermarker.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/RedactedAndWatermarked.docx");
   ```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Access Issues**: Ensure file paths and permissions are correctly set.
- **Compatibility Problems**: Verify that document formats supported by GroupDocs libraries are correct.

## Practical Applications
1. **Legal Document Handling**: Remove sensitive annotations before sharing drafts with clients.
2. **Corporate Compliance**: Ensure documents meet industry standards for information security.
3. **Educational Materials**: Clean up student submissions for grading and feedback.

Integrate these functionalities into document management systems to enhance data integrity and confidentiality.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Manage memory by disposing of objects promptly using `using` statements.
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple documents in batches to improve efficiency.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilize async methods for non-blocking operations where applicable.

Adopt these best practices to ensure smooth and efficient document processing with GroupDocs libraries.
