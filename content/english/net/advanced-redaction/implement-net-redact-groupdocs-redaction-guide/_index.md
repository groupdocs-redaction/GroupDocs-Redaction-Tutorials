3. **Knowledge Prerequisites:**
   - Basic understanding of C# programming.
   - Familiarity with document manipulation in .NET applications.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET
### Installation Information

```

**Package Manager Console:**

To use GroupDocs.Redaction, obtain a license as follows:
- **Free Trial:** Download from [GroupDocs](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) to evaluate features.
- **Temporary License:** Apply for a temporary full-feature license on their website.
- **Purchase:** Acquire a commercial license if you find the tool meets your needs.

### Basic Initialization
Hereâ€™s how you can initialize GroupDocs.Redaction in your application:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Redaction;
// Initialize Redactor with source document path
using (Redactor redactor = new Redactor("path/to/document.docx"))
{
    // Apply redactions and save the changes here.
}
```

## Implementation Guide
### Step-by-Step Feature Implementation
#### Overview of Redacting Documents
This feature allows you to replace specific text in documents with a visual marker, ensuring sensitive data remains hidden. We'll focus on applying an exact phrase redaction.

##### Step 1: Define the Source File Path
Start by specifying where your document is located. Replace `@YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY` with the actual path:

```csharp
string sourceFile = "@YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/YourDocument.docx";
```

##### Step 2: Initialize Redactor
Create an instance of the `Redactor` class, which handles the redaction process.

```csharp
using (Redactor redactor = new Redactor(sourceFile))
{
    // Further steps will be performed here.
}
```

##### Step 3: Apply Exact Phrase Redaction
Use `ExactPhraseRedaction` to specify the text to redact and how it should be replaced. In this example, "John Doe" is replaced with a red box.

```csharp
RedactorChangeLog result = redactor.Apply(new ExactPhraseRedaction("John Doe", new ReplacementOptions(System.Drawing.Color.Red)));
```

##### Step 4: Save the Redacted Document
If successful, overwrite the original document by saving it. Ensure to check for any failures in the process:

```csharp
if (result.Status != RedactionStatus.Failed)
{
    var outputFile = redactor.Save(new SaveOptions() { AddSuffix = false, RasterizeToPDF = false });
    Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document was redacted successfully.\nFile saved to {outputFile}.\n");
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the source file path is correct and accessible.
- Verify that you have write permissions for saving the modified file.
- Confirm that your license allows full functionality if using a trial version.
