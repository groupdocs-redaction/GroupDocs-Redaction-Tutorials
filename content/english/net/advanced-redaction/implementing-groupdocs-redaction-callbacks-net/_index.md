# How to Implement GroupDocs.Redaction Callbacks in .NET for Secure Document Handling

## Introduction

In today’s digital age, protecting sensitive information is more critical than ever. Whether you're working on legal documents, financial reports, or personal data, ensuring confidentiality through redaction is a necessity. The GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET library offers a powerful solution by enabling developers to automate the process of identifying and masking confidential content in various document formats.

In this tutorial, we’ll guide you through implementing the `IRedactionCallback` interface using GroupDocs.Redaction .NET. This feature allows you to handle redactions effectively and track changes with precision. By the end of this guide, you'll learn:
- How to set up your environment for GroupDocs.Redaction
- The steps involved in implementing a redaction callback
- Practical applications of redaction callbacks
- Performance considerations when using GroupDocs.Redaction

Let’s get started by covering the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the implementation, ensure you have the following:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies:
- **GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET**: At least version 21.3 or later.
- Development Environment: Visual Studio (2017 or newer) with .NET Framework 4.6.1 or higher.

### Knowledge Prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of C# programming
- Familiarity with handling file operations in .NET

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET

To begin using GroupDocs.Redaction, you first need to install it within your development environment.

**.NET CLI Installation:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Redaction
```

**Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Redaction
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
Search for "GroupDocs.Redaction" in the NuGet Package Manager and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition:
- **Free Trial**: Download a free trial from [GroupDocs](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) to explore the full features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license if you need more time for evaluation purposes.
- **Purchase**: Purchase a license for long-term usage and support.

### Basic Initialization:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Redaction;

RedactorSettings settings = new RedactorSettings();
```

## Implementation Guide

Implementing the `IRedactionCallback` interface allows you to customize how redactions are handled. Let's walk through the steps:

### Overview of IRedactionCallback
The `IRedactionCallback` interface provides a mechanism to track and handle each redaction operation, enabling you to log or audit these changes as they occur.

#### Step 1: Define Your Callback Class
Create a class that implements `IRedactionCallback`. This callback will print the details of each redaction processed.

**Code Snippet:**
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Redaction.Redactions;
using System;

public class RedactionDump : IRedactionCallback
{
    public bool AcceptRedaction(RedactionDescription description)
    {
        // Print details of the redaction being processed
        Console.Write("{0} redaction, {1} action, item {2}. \
