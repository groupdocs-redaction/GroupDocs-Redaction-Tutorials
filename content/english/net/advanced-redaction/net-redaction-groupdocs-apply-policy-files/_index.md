// Your code setup goes here.
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Apply Redaction Policy to Files Efficiently

This feature demonstrates how to apply a redaction policy across multiple files within a specified directory. Follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Prepare Output Directories

Create directories for storing successfully processed files and those that fail during processing.

```csharp
string sourceFile = Utils.PrepareOutputDirectory("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/PolicyFile.json");
var path = Path.GetDirectoryName(sourceFile);
string success_path = Path.Combine(path, "Success");
if (!Directory.Exists(success_path)) { Directory.CreateDirectory(success_path); }
string fail_path = Path.Combine(path, "Fail");
if (!Directory.Exists(fail_path)) { Directory.CreateDirectory(fail_path); }
```

#### Step 2: Load Redaction Policy

Load your redaction policy from a predefined JSON file containing rules for data to be redacted.

```csharp
RedactionPolicy policy = RedactionPolicy.Load(sourceFile);
```

#### Step 3: Apply Redaction Policy to Files

Iterate through each file in your input directory, apply the redaction policy, and save the output accordingly.

```csharp
foreach (var fileEntry in Directory.GetFiles("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Inbound"))
{
    using (Redactor redactor = new Redactor(fileEntry))
    {
        // Apply the redaction policy.
        RedactorChangeLog result = redactor.Apply(policy);

        // Determine where to save the output based on processing status.
        String resultFolder = result.Status != RedactionStatus.Failed ? success_path : fail_path;
        var outputFile = Path.Combine(resultFolder, Path.GetFileName(fileEntry));

        // Save the processed file.
        using (Stream fileStream = File.Create(outputFile))
        {
            redactor.Save(fileStream, new RasterizationOptions() { Enabled = false });
        }
    }
}
```

### Feature 2: Directory Preparation for Redaction Output

This feature ensures that directories for storing output files are ready before processing begins. The above code snippet efficiently handles this step.

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Redaction can be applied in various scenarios, such as:
1. **Legal Document Management**: Automatically redact sensitive client information from legal documents.
2. **Financial Reporting**: Ensure compliance by masking confidential financial data in reports.
3. **Healthcare Records Processing**: Protect patient privacy by redacting identifiable information from medical records.
4. **Government Document Sharing**: Safeguard citizen data when distributing public documents.
5. **Human Resources Management**: Anonymize personal details in HR documents before sharing internally.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large datasets or numerous files, consider these tips to optimize performance:
- Use asynchronous file operations where possible.
- Manage memory efficiently by disposing of streams and objects promptly.
- Implement logging to monitor processing times and identify bottlenecks.

Following best practices for .NET memory management will ensure your application runs smoothly without excessive resource consumption.
