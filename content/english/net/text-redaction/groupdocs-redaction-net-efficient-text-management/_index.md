## Implementation Guide

### Plain Text Document Loader

**Overview:**
Loading plain text documents efficiently is crucial for any document management system. This feature allows you to read content from a stream, line by line, ensuring that only non-empty lines are stored in memory.

#### Step 1: Initialize and Clear Content
Start by creating an instance of `PlainTextDocumentLoader`:
```csharp
public class PlainTextDocumentLoader
{
    private List<string> FileContent { get; set; }

    public PlainTextDocumentLoader()
    {
        FileContent = new List<string>();
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Load Content from a Stream
Implement the `Load` method to read and store lines:
```csharp
public void Load(Stream input)
{
    FileContent.Clear();
    using (var reader = new StreamReader(input))
    {
        string line;
        while ((line = reader.ReadLine()) != null)
        {
            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(line))
            {
                FileContent.Add(line);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Parameters and Methods:**
- `input`: The stream from which to read the document.
- `StreamReader`: Utilized for efficient reading line by line.

### Plain Text Document Saver

**Overview:**
After processing, you'll need to save the content back into a file or another stream. This ensures that any modifications are persisted.

#### Step 1: Initialize with Content
Create an instance of `PlainTextDocumentSaver`:
```csharp
public class PlainTextDocumentSaver
{
    private List<string> FileContent { get; set; }

    public PlainTextDocumentSaver(List<string> fileContent)
    {
        FileContent = fileContent ?? new List<string>();
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Save Content to a Stream
Implement the `Save` method:
```csharp
public void Save(Stream output)
{
    using (var writer = new StreamWriter(output))
    {
        foreach (var line in FileContent)
        {
            writer.WriteLine(line);
        }
    }
}
```

**Parameters and Methods:**
- `output`: The stream to which the content will be saved.
- `StreamWriter`: Ensures efficient writing operations.

### Text Replacement in Plain Text Document

**Overview:**
Modifying text within documents can be easily achieved using regular expressions. This feature replaces specified patterns with new text.

#### Step 1: Initialize with Content
Create an instance of `TextReplacer`:
```csharp
public class TextReplacer
{
    private List<string> FileContent { get; set; }

    public TextReplacer(List<string> fileContent)
    {
        FileContent = fileContent ?? new List<string>();
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement Text Replacement
Use the `ReplaceText` method to perform replacements:
```csharp
public string ReplaceText(Regex regex, string replacement)
{
    try
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < FileContent.Count; i++)
        {
            FileContent[i] = regex.Replace(FileContent[i], replacement);
        }
        return "Replacement successful.";
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        return $"Failed: {ex.Message}";
    }
}
```

**Parameters and Methods:**
- `regex`: The regular expression pattern to search for.
- `replacement`: The text that will replace matches found by the regex.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Stream Issues**: Ensure streams are correctly opened/closed to avoid data corruption.
- **Regex Errors**: Validate your regex patterns before use to prevent runtime exceptions.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where these features shine:

1. **Data Masking**: Automatically redact sensitive information in documents before sharing.
2. **Template Filling**: Populate templates with dynamic content for automated report generation.
3. **Log Analysis**: Streamline log file processing by replacing or removing unnecessary details.

Integration with other systems, such as databases or web services, can further enhance document management capabilities.

## Performance Considerations

- Use buffered streams to optimize I/O operations when handling large files.
- Manage memory usage by clearing lists and disposing of resources promptly after use.
- Utilize asynchronous programming models for non-blocking file operations.

## Conclusion
