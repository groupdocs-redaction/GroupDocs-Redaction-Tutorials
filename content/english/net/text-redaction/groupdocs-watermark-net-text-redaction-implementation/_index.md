## Implementation Guide: Using IRedactionCallback for Text Redaction

Now, let's explore how to use the IRedactionCallback interface to implement text redaction in your documents. This feature allows you to replace sensitive information with placeholders securely.

### Overview of IRedactionCallback

The `IRedactionCallback` interface provides a way to handle redaction events and customize the redaction process. By implementing this interface, you can control how text is obscured or replaced during the redaction operation.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1. Define Your Callback Class

Create a class that implements `IRedactionCallback`. This class will define what happens when a redaction occurs.

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Redaction;
using GroupDocs.Redaction.Redactions;

public class CustomRedactionCallback : IRedactionCallback
{
    public void RedactAction(ReplacementOptions options)
    {
        // Customize the replacement text or handle other logic here.
        options.Replacement = "[REDACTED]";
    }
}
```

#### 2. Apply Redaction with Callback

Use the `CustomRedactionCallback` within your redaction process to specify how redactions should be handled.

```csharp
using (Redactor redactor = new Redactor("SampleDocx.docx\
