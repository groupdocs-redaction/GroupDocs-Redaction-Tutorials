```
This setup prepares your environment to start working with PDF redactions using .NET.

## Implementation Guide

### Feature Overview: Regex-Based Paragraph Redaction

In this section, we focus on using regex patterns to identify and redact entire paragraphs from a PDF document. This method is efficient for bulk redacting similar text structures across documents.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### Step 1: Define the Source File Path
Specify the path to your target PDF file:

```csharp
string sourceFile = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\LOREMIPSUM_PDF.pdf";
```

##### Step 2: Initialize the Redactor
Create an instance of the `Redactor` class using the specified file:

```csharp
using (Redactor redactor = new Redactor(sourceFile))
{
    // Further steps will be implemented here.
}
```
This object manages redaction operations on your PDF.

##### Step 3: Apply RegexRedaction
Use a regex pattern to find and redact the desired text:

```csharp
redactor.Apply(new RegexRedaction(
