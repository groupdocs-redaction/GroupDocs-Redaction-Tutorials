# How to Extract Document Metadata from Streams Using GroupDocs.Redaction .NET

## Introduction

Are you tired of manually extracting document information or dealing with large files that slow down your workflow? The GroupDocs.Redaction library for .NET offers a streamlined solution to efficiently retrieve and manage document metadata. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through using GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET to extract crucial information from documents loaded directly from streams.

**What You’ll Learn:**
- How to set up your environment with GroupDocs.Redaction
- Extracting file type, page count, and size from a document stream
- Preparing an output directory for document handling

Let's dive into the prerequisites you need before we get started!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies:
- GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET (latest version)
- .NET Framework or .NET Core/5+/6+ compatible environment
- Basic knowledge of C# programming and file handling in .NET

### Environment Setup Requirements:
- Visual Studio 2019 or later installed on your machine

Once you have the essentials ready, let’s set up GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET

To use GroupDocs.Redaction, install it via one of these methods:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Redaction
```

**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Redaction
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Open NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.
- Search for "GroupDocs.Redaction" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition Steps:
1. **Free Trial:** Download a trial license to explore all features of GroupDocs.Redaction without restrictions.
2. **Temporary License:** Request a temporary license from [GroupDocs](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for extended testing.
3. **Purchase:** If satisfied, consider purchasing a commercial license for production use.

### Basic Initialization and Setup:
Once installed, initialize GroupDocs.Redaction in your project like this:

```csharp
using (Redactor redactor = new Redactor("your-document-path"))
{
    // Use the redactor here
}
```

Now that we have everything set up, let’s move on to the implementation guide.

## Implementation Guide

We'll break down our task into two main features: extracting document metadata from a stream and preparing an output directory for storing outputs. 

### Feature 1: Extract Document Metadata from Stream

#### Overview:
This feature allows you to load a document from a file stream, extract metadata such as file type, page count, and size, and then display this information.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:

**Prepare the Source File Path:**
Start by ensuring your output directory exists using a utility method.

```csharp
string sourceFile = Utils.PrepareOutputDirectory("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX");
```

*Why?*
This step ensures that your document is accessible and prepares the necessary file path for processing.

**Open the Document Stream:**
Next, open the document stream using `File.OpenRead()`.

```csharp
using (Stream documentStream = File.OpenRead(sourceFile))
{
    // Proceed to initialize Redactor
}
```

*Why?*
Accessing the document as a stream allows for efficient memory usage and is crucial for processing large files without loading them entirely into memory.

**Initialize the Redactor with the Document Stream:**
Initialize `Redactor` using the opened document stream.

```csharp
using (Redactor redactor = new Redactor(documentStream))
{
    // Extract document info next
}
```

*Why?*
The `Redactor` object provides access to various features, including metadata extraction from documents.

**Retrieve Document Metadata:**
Use `GetDocumentInfo()` to obtain the document's metadata.

```csharp
IDocumentInfo info = redactor.GetDocumentInfo();
string fileInfo = $"\nFile type: {info.FileType}\nNumber of pages: {info.PageCount}\nDocument size: {info.Size} bytes";
Console.WriteLine(fileInfo);
```

*Why?*
This step is essential for gathering document metadata, which can be crucial for processing and categorizing documents.

### Feature 2: Prepare Output Directory

#### Overview:
Ensure the target directory exists before writing files to it, preventing errors during file operations.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:

**Define a Method to Check and Create Directory:**
Implement a method that verifies the existence of your output directory or creates it if necessary.

```csharp
public static class Utils
{
    public static string PrepareOutputDirectory(string sampleDocPath)
    {
        string directory = Path.GetDirectoryName(sampleDocPath);
        
        if (!Directory.Exists(directory))
        {
            Directory.CreateDirectory(directory);
        }
        
        return Path.Combine(directory, "SAMPLE_DOCX.docx");
    }
}
```

*Why?*
Creating a reliable output path is crucial to avoid runtime errors and ensure that your application can save files without issues.

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure you have write permissions for the directory.
- Verify the file path syntax is correct; incorrect paths will result in `DirectoryNotFoundException`.

## Practical Applications

Using GroupDocs.Redaction for .NET opens up several practical applications:
1. **Automated Document Processing:** Quickly extract and categorize documents based on metadata, streamlining workflows.
2. **Legal and Compliance Audits:** Automatically retrieve document information to ensure compliance with regulations.
3. **Data Management Systems:** Integrate metadata extraction into your data management systems for enhanced searchability.

## Performance Considerations

When working with GroupDocs.Redaction in .NET applications:
- **Memory Management:** Utilize streams efficiently by disposing of them after use, as shown in our examples.
- **Optimizing Resource Usage:** Process documents in batches to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput.

By following these best practices, you can ensure your application runs smoothly while handling large volumes of document data.
