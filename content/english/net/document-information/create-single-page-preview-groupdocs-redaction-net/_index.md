## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll break down generating a single-page preview using GroupDocs.Redaction. Each step guides you through the implementation seamlessly.

### Overview
This feature lets you extract and preview a specific page from your documents in PNG format, crucial for presentations or quick reviews without sharing entire files.

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment
Ensure that your source document path is correctly set up. Use utility functions efficiently for handling file paths:

```csharp
// Define the directory and file name for output.
string sourceFile = Utils.PrepareOutputDirectory("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY");
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Preview Options
Define the specific page you want to preview and customize your image settings using `PreviewOptions`:

```csharp
int testPageNumber = 1;
string previewFileName = Utils.GetOutputFileByName(sourceFile, $"preview_page{testPageNumber}");

// Initialize the Redactor with the source file.
using (Redactor redactor = new Redactor(sourceFile))
{
    PreviewOptions options = new PreviewOptions(pageNumber => File.OpenWrite(previewFileName));

    // Set dimensions and format for the preview image.
    options.Width = 480;
    options.Height = 640;
    options.PageNumbers = new int[] { testPageNumber };
    options.PreviewFormat = PreviewOptions.PreviewFormats.PNG;

    // Generate and save the page preview.
    redactor.GeneratePreview(options);
}
```

### Explanation of Key Configurations
- **Width & Height**: Customize these dimensions to suit your display needs.
- **PageNumbers**: Specify which pages you wish to include in the preview.
- **PreviewFormat**: Currently set to PNG, but can be modified according to your requirements.
