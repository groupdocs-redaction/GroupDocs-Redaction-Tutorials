## Implementation Guide

### Remove Last Page from PDF

#### Overview
This feature allows you to remove the last page of any document, providing greater control over your content.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Open the Document for Redaction**
```csharp
using (Redactor redactor = new Redactor(sourceFile))
{
    // Code continues...
}
```
*Why*: The `Redactor` object loads and manages the document, ensuring modifications are safely applied.

**2. Retrieve Document Information**
```csharp
var documentInfo = redactor.GetDocumentInfo();
```
*Why*: Checking for available pages is crucial before attempting any removal operations.

**3. Ensure the Document Has Pages**
```csharp
if (documentInfo.PageCount >= 1)
{
    // Proceed with page removal.
}
```
*Why*: This condition prevents errors by ensuring there's at least one page to remove.

**4. Apply RemovePageRedaction**
```csharp
redactor.Apply(new RemovePageRedaction(PageSeekOrigin.End, 0, 1));
```
*Why*: `RemovePageRedaction` targets the last page using a zero-based index from `PageSeekOrigin.End`.

**5. Save the Modified Document**
```csharp
var outputFile = redactor.Save(new SaveOptions() { AddSuffix = true, RasterizeToPDF = false });
Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document was redacted successfully.\nFile saved to {outputFile}.\n");
```
*Why*: Saving with options ensures that your changes are stored correctly without rasterizing the content.

### Prepare Output Directory for Saving Files

#### Overview
Organizing output files in a designated directory streamlines file management and enhances workflow efficiency.

**1. Check if the Directory Exists**
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

if (!Directory.Exists(outputDirectory))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
}
```
*Why*: Automatically creating missing directories prevents runtime errors during file saving.

**2. Copy File to Output Directory (if needed)**
```csharp
string PrepareOutputDirectory(string filePath)
{
    string fileName = Path.GetFileName(filePath);
    string fullPath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, fileName);

    if (!File.Exists(fullPath))
    {
        File.Copy(filePath, fullPath);
    }

    return fullPath;
}
```
*Why*: This method ensures the source file is available in your output directory for further operations.

## Practical Applications
1. **Document Privacy**: Automatically remove sensitive information from end pages.
2. **Report Generation**: Refine reports by eliminating unnecessary summary sections.
3. **Legal Documentation**: Tailor legal documents to meet specific requirements by removing extraneous appendices.
4. **Integration with Document Management Systems**: Seamlessly integrate this feature into larger document management workflows.
5. **Automated Processing Pipelines**: Use in batch processing for large volumes of PDFs requiring last-page removal.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Keep your application's memory footprint low by disposing of `Redactor` objects properly after use.
- **Batch Process Efficiently**: When dealing with numerous documents, consider using asynchronous methods to prevent blocking operations.
- **Resource Management**: Regularly monitor resource usage, especially in high-load environments.
