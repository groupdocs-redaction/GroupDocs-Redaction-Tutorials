# Listing Supported File Formats with GroupDocs.Watermark .NET

## Introduction

Are you unsure about which file formats are compatible with your document management solution? Identifying supported file types is crucial for developers using GroupDocs.Redaction to efficiently handle document processing and redaction tasks. This tutorial will guide you through listing all supported file formats using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to retrieve a list of supported file formats in GroupDocs.Redaction.
- Steps to order these formats by extension.
- Best practices for implementing this feature with GroupDocs.Watermark.

Let's start by setting up the necessary prerequisites!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

### Required Libraries and Versions
- **GroupDocs.Redaction** - Ensure itâ€™s installed in your project.
- **.NET Framework 4.6.1 or later** - Your application needs a compatible .NET environment.

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A C# development environment (Visual Studio is recommended).
- Basic understanding of LINQ for data manipulation and ordering.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET

To work with GroupDocs.Watermark, add the necessary package to your project:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**
- Search for "GroupDocs.Watermark" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition
You can start with a free trial or obtain a temporary license to explore the full capabilities of GroupDocs.Watermark. For ongoing use, consider purchasing a license for commercial projects.

### Basic Initialization and Setup
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Watermark;

// Initialize Watermarker
Watermarker watermarker = new Watermarker("your-file-path");
```

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll demonstrate how to list supported file formats using GroupDocs.Redaction with integration in GroupDocs.Watermark.

### Feature: Retrieve Supported File Formats

#### Overview
Retrieving the list of supported file formats is essential for preprocessing tasks in document handling solutions. This feature allows you to understand which documents can be processed with your current setup.

#### Step 1: Retrieve Supported File Types
Start by fetching all supported file types using GroupDocs.Redaction:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using GroupDocs.Redaction;

IEnumerable<FileType> supportedFileTypes = FileType.GetSupportedFileFormats();
```
**Explanation**: This line fetches a collection of `FileType` objects representing all formats that can be redacted.

#### Step 2: Order File Types by Extension
For better readability, order the file types based on their extensions:
```csharp
var orderedFileTypes = supportedFileTypes.OrderBy(f => f.Extension);
```
**Explanation**: The `OrderBy` method is used here to sort the list alphabetically by file extension.

#### Step 3: Iterate and Process Each File Type
Process each file type as needed. For demonstration, you can print them:
```csharp
foreach (FileType fileType in orderedFileTypes)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Extension: {fileType.Extension}, Format: {fileType.FileFormat}");
}
```
**Explanation**: This loop iterates over the sorted list and prints out each format's extension and name.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue**: File formats not listed. Ensure GroupDocs.Redaction is properly installed.
- **Solution**: Verify that your project references are up to date with the latest version of the library.

## Practical Applications
1. **Document Redaction**: Automatically filter and redact supported document types in bulk processing systems.
2. **File Type Validation**: Implement validation checks to ensure only supported file formats are processed by your application.
3. **Integration with Workflow Systems**: Enhance automated workflows that handle diverse document types using the compatibility check.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance when listing and working with supported file formats:
- **Caching**: Cache the list of supported file types if they don't change often to reduce repetitive querying.
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of `Watermarker` objects properly to free up resources after processing documents.
  
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to retrieve and order supported file formats using GroupDocs.Redaction with GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET. These steps are crucial for developers looking to enhance document management systems.

**Next Steps**: Explore additional features of GroupDocs.Watermark by integrating them into your projects and checking out the API reference for more functionalities.
