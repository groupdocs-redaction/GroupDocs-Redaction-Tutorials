# Implement Metered Licensing & Document Redaction with GroupDocs for .NET
## Introduction
Managing document security and API usage efficiently is crucial when dealing with sensitive information or large-scale APIs. **GroupDocs.Redaction** and **GroupDocs.Watermark** offer powerful solutions to protect documents from unauthorized access and track API usage effectively.

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through setting up a metered license system using GroupDocs.Redaction and perform text redaction in documents. Additionally, you'll learn how to integrate GroupDocs.Watermark for enhanced document management tasks. By the end of this guide, you’ll have practical skills to improve your .NET applications.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up a metered license using GroupDocs.Redaction
- Performing text redaction with precise matching
- Integrating GroupDocs.Watermark for additional document management features

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure your environment is set up to work with **GroupDocs.Redaction** and **GroupDocs.Watermark** for .NET:

- **Required Libraries:** Include GroupDocs.Redaction and GroupDocs.Watermark in your project.
- **.NET Environment:** This tutorial assumes you are using .NET 5.0 or later.
- **Knowledge Prerequisites:** A basic understanding of C# is necessary.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET
To start, install the GroupDocs.Watermark library in your project:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Watermark
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:** Search for "GroupDocs.Watermark" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition
Choose from these licensing options:
- **Free Trial:** Test features with a temporary license.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain a free trial for testing purposes.
- **Purchase:** Acquire full access by purchasing a license.

Begin by initializing your application with the necessary credentials:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Redaction;
// Initialize Metered API
Metered metered = new Metered();
metered.SetMeteredKey("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY", "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY");
```

## Implementation Guide
### Setting Up a Metered License with GroupDocs.Redaction
#### Overview
A metered license allows tracking and limiting your application’s API usage.

#### Step 1: Initialize Metered API
```csharp
Metered metered = new Metered();
metered.SetMeteredKey("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY", "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY");
```

Authenticate and configure your application using `SetMeteredKey`.

#### Step 2: Monitor Consumption Metrics
Track API usage with:
```csharp
decimal consumptionQuantity = Metered.GetConsumptionQuantity();
decimal consumptionCredit = Metered.GetConsumptionCredit();
```
These methods help monitor operations versus available credit.

### Redacting Text in Documents with GroupDocs.Redaction
#### Overview
Text redaction protects sensitive information. This section covers loading a document and applying text redactions using exact phrase matching.

#### Step 1: Load Document
```csharp
string sourceFile = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.docx";
using (Redactor redactor = new Redactor(sourceFile))
{
    // Proceed with redaction operations here
}
```
Ensure the document path is correct.

#### Step 2: Apply Exact Phrase Redaction
Identify and obscure specific text:
```csharp
RedactorChangeLog result = redactor.Apply(new ExactPhraseRedaction("John Doe", new ReplacementOptions(Color.Red)));
string outputFile = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\\redacted.docx";
redactor.Save(outputFile);
```
Here, "John Doe" is replaced with a red rectangle.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure API keys are correctly configured.
- Verify document paths and file permissions if errors occur during loading or saving.

## Practical Applications
GroupDocs tools offer various use cases:
1. **Document Security:** Redact personal information from contracts before sharing.
2. **Compliance Management:** Automatically redact sensitive data to meet regulatory requirements.
3. **API Usage Monitoring:** Manage API usage efficiently with metered licenses.

Integrating these features can enhance operations in legal, finance, and healthcare sectors.

## Performance Considerations
For optimal performance:
- Monitor API consumption metrics regularly.
- Schedule document processing during off-peak hours for better resource allocation.
- Use .NET memory management techniques for handling large documents efficiently.

## Conclusion
Setting up a metered license with GroupDocs.Redaction and performing text redactions helps manage both document security and API usage effectively. Integrating these capabilities into your applications enhances data protection and operational efficiency.

**Next Steps:**
- Experiment with additional features of GroupDocs libraries.
- Explore integration possibilities with other systems to enhance functionality.
